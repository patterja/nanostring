# Nanostring processing

Knight Diagnoistics Laboratory

1) Processes RCC files from nanostring (looks like type of xml) to raw data file
2) Raw data file to normalized output


## Nanostring Normalization

1) Correction by average of geometric means of ERCC control, acts as a pseudo loading control
2) Correction by average of geometric means of all samples (columns)
3) Proportional increase from corresponding IgG, rabbit or mouse, for each Ab
